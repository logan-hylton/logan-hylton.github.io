	 * Problem 1: Create a function that returns the remainder you would get from dividing 
	 * 	two numbers a and b, where a is divided by b.
	 * 
	 * Example: a = 4; b = 3; your function should return 1
	 * Example: a = 4; b = 2; your function should return 0
	 * 
	 * For testing purposes your function must be named remainderAB

	 * Example: a = 4; b = 2; c = -1; your function should return -8

	 * Example: a = 1.50; your function should return 0.50 or 0.5
